                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hello, my name is Alexander Rolette and I am a Writing and Rhetoric major with a Marketing minor.</p>
                    
                <p>I began my time at the University of Central Florida with a heavy focus on field of Marketing. I heard from employers how they wish their new-hires would be able to quickly communicate effectively when joining their company. With my background in writing and rhetoric, I have been able to analyze the local workplace situation and ensure success.</p>
        
                <p>I bring with me 5 years of experience in marketing research and social media content with a demonstrated history of working in business to consumer, as well as business to business-focused companies. Understanding who best to market to is as important as the art of marketing itself and to do that, one needs to ensure that they can identify and hone in on whatever opportunities are possible.</p>
                    
                <p>On this site, I will be posting my past and present experiences with professional communication, from internships and assignments to personal projects. My hope is that this page helps convince you that I am exactly who you're looking for.</p>
